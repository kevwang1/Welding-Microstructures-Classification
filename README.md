# Microstructure Analysis of Metal in Welding Joints

Research on automating analysis of microstructures in welding joints. In collaboration with [Prof. Patricio Mendez](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~ccwj/people/professors/mendez/) and his team at the [Canadian Centre for Joining and Welding](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~ccwj/).

## Background
The microstructures in a metal are the patterns observed under a microscope at the micrometer scale (i.e. 10-100x). The microstructure of a metal can strongly influence physical properties such as strength, toughness, ductility, hardness, corrosion resistance, high/low temperature behaviour or wear resistance. Through visual analysis by trained experts, one can determine significant information about the physical properties of a metal through simply looking at an image of microstructures. For more information on microstructures: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstructure).

## Problem
To perform quality assurance in welding processes, visual analysis of welding joint microstructure is a common technique. However, this is a extremely time-consuming task. Normally, a metallurgist will perform visual analysis by overlaying a grid of 1000 points over the image, and classifying the microstructure
